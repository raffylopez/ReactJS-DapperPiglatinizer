ripgrep 0.7.1
Andrew Gallant <jamslam@gmail.com>

ripgrep (rg) recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.

ripgrep's regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees linear time
searching. Because of this, features like backreferences and arbitrary
lookaround are not supported.

Note that ripgrep may abort unexpectedly when using default settings if it
searches a file that is simultaneously truncated. This behavior can be avoided
by passing the --no-mmap flag.

USAGE:
    rg [options] PATTERN [path ...]
    rg [options] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f FILE ...] [path ...]
    rg [options] --files [path ...]
    rg [options] --type-list

ARGS:
    <PATTERN>    
            A regular expression used for searching. To match a pattern beginning
            with a dash, use the -e/--regexp option.
             
    <path>...    
            A file or directory to search. Directories are searched recursively.
             

OPTIONS:
    -A, --after-context <NUM>               
            Show NUM lines after each match.
             
    -B, --before-context <NUM>              
            Show NUM lines before each match.
             
    -s, --case-sensitive                    
            Search case sensitively. This overrides -i/--ignore-case and -S/--smart
            -case.
             
        --color <WHEN>                      
            When to use color in the output. The possible values are never, auto,
            always or ansi. The default is auto. When always is used, coloring is
            attempted based on your environment. When ansi is used, coloring is
            forcefully done using ANSI escape color codes.
             
        --colors <SPEC>...                  
            This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may
            be provided multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively. Colors are
            limited to one of eight choices: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta,
            yellow, white and black. Styles are limited to nobold, bold, nointense
            or intense.
            
            The format of the flag is {type}:{attribute}:{value}. {type} should be
            one of path, line, column or match. {attribute} can be fg, bg or style.
            {value} is either a color (for fg and bg) or a text style. A special
            format, {type}:none, will clear all color settings for {type}.
            
            For example, the following command will change the match color to
            magenta and the background color for line numbers to yellow:
            
            rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo.
             
        --column                            
            Show column numbers (1-based). This only shows the column numbers for
            the first match on each line. This does not try to account for Unicode.
            One byte is equal to one column. This implies --line-number.
             
    -C, --context <NUM>
            Show NUM lines before and after each match.
             
        --context-separator <SEPARATOR>
            The string used to separate non-contiguous context lines in the output.
            Escape sequences like \x7F or \t may be used. The default value is --.
             
    -c, --count
            Only show count of matches for each file.
             
        --debug                             
            Show debug messages. Please use this when filing a bug report.
             
        --dfa-size-limit <NUM+SUFFIX?>
            The upper size limit of the generated dfa. The default limit is 10M.
            This should only be changed on very large regex inputs where the
            (slower) fallback regex engine may otherwise be used. 
            
            The argument accepts the same size suffixes as allowed in the 'max
            -filesize' argument.
             
    -E, --encoding <ENCODING>
            Specify the text encoding that ripgrep will use on all files searched.
            The default value is 'auto', which will cause ripgrep to do a best
            effort automatic detection of encoding on a per-file basis. Other
            supported values can be found in the list of labels here:
            https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-encoding-get
             
    -f, --file <FILE>...                    
            Search for patterns from the given file, with one pattern per line. When
            this flag is used or multiple times or in combination with the
            -e/--regexp flag, then all patterns provided are searched. Empty pattern
            lines will match all input lines, and the newline is not counted as part
            of the pattern.
             
        --files                             
            Print each file that would be searched without actually performing the
            search. This is useful to determine whether a particular file is being
            searched or not.
             
    -l, --files-with-matches
            Only show the paths with at least one match.
             
        --files-without-match
            Only show the paths that contains zero matches.
             
    -F, --fixed-strings                     
            Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.
            When this flag is used, special regular expression meta characters such
            as (){}*+. do not need to be escaped.
             
    -L, --follow                            
            Follow symbolic links.
             
    -g, --glob <GLOB>...                    
            Include or exclude files/directories for searching that match the given
            glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags
            may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with
            a ! to exclude it.
             
    -h, --help
            Prints help information. Use --help for more details.

        --heading                           
            This shows the file name above clusters of matches from each file
            instead of showing the file name for every match. This is the default
            mode at a tty.
             
        --hidden                            
            Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and
            directories are skipped.
             
        --iglob <GLOB>...
            Include or exclude files/directories for searching that match the given
            glob. This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags
            may be used. Globbing rules match .gitignore globs. Precede a glob with
            a ! to exclude it. Globs are matched case insensitively.
             
    -i, --ignore-case                       
            Case insensitive search. This is overridden by --case-sensitive.
             
        --ignore-file <FILE>...             
            Specify additional ignore files for filtering file paths. Ignore files
            should be in the gitignore format and are matched relative to the
            current working directory. These ignore files have lower precedence than
            all other ignore files. When specifying multiple ignore files, earlier
            files have lower precedence than later files.
             
    -v, --invert-match                      
            Invert matching. Show lines that don't match given patterns.
             
    -n, --line-number                       
            Show line numbers (1-based). This is enabled by default when searching
            in a tty.
             
    -x, --line-regexp
            Only show matches surrounded by line boundaries. This is equivalent to
            putting ^...$ around all of the search patterns.
             
    -M, --max-columns <NUM>
            Don't print lines longer than this limit in bytes. Longer lines are
            omitted, and only the number of matches in that line is printed.
             
    -m, --max-count <NUM>                   
            Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.
             
        --max-filesize <NUM+SUFFIX?>        
            Ignore files larger than NUM in size. Does not ignore directories. 
            
            The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G which correspond to
            kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes. If no suffix is provided the input
            is treated as bytes. 
            
            Example: --max-filesize 50K or --max-filesize 80M
             
        --maxdepth <NUM>                    
            Limit the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond the paths
            given. A value of zero only searches the starting-points themselves.
            
            For example, 'rg --maxdepth 0 dir/' is a no-op because dir/ will not be
            descended into. 'rg --maxdepth 1 dir/' will search only the direct
            children of dir/.
             
        --mmap
            Search using memory maps when possible. This is enabled by default when
            ripgrep thinks it will be faster. Note that memory map searching doesn't
            currently support all options, so if an incompatible option (e.g.,
            --context) is given with --mmap, then memory maps will not be used.
             
        --no-filename                       
            Never show the file name for a match. This is the default when one file
            is searched.
             
        --no-heading                        
            Don't group matches by each file. If -H/--with-filename is enabled, then
            file names will be shown for every line matched. This is the default
            mode when not at a tty.
             
        --no-ignore                         
            Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.). This implies
            --no-ignore-parent and --no-ignore-vcs.
             
        --no-ignore-parent
            Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.) in parent
            directories.
             
        --no-ignore-vcs                     
            Don't respect version control ignore files (.gitignore, etc.). This
            implies --no-ignore-parent. Note that .ignore files will continue to be
            respected.
             
    -N, --no-line-number                    
            Suppress line numbers. This is enabled by default when NOT searching in
            a tty.
             
        --no-messages                       
            Suppress all error messages. This is equivalent to redirecting stderr to
            /dev/null.
             
        --no-mmap                           
            Never use memory maps, even when they might be faster.
             
    -0, --null                              
            Whenever a file name is printed, follow it with a NUL byte. This
            includes printing file names before matches, and when printing a list of
            matching files such as with --count, --files-with-matches and --files.
            This option is useful for use with xargs.
             
    -o, --only-matching                     
            Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each
            such part on a separate output line.
             
        --path-separator <SEPARATOR>
            The path separator to use when printing file paths. This defaults to
            your platform's path separator, which is / on Unix and \ on Windows.
            This flag is intended for overriding the default when the environment
            demands it (e.g., cygwin). A path separator is limited to a single byte.
             
    -p, --pretty
            Alias for --color always --heading --line-number.
             
    -q, --quiet                             
            Do not print anything to stdout. If a match is found in a file, stop
            searching. This is useful when ripgrep is used only for its exit code.
             
        --regex-size-limit <NUM+SUFFIX?>
            The upper size limit of the compiled regex. The default limit is 10M. 
            
            The argument accepts the same size suffixes as allowed in the 'max
            -filesize' argument.
             
    -e, --regexp <PATTERN>...               
            Use pattern to search. This option can be provided multiple times, where
            all patterns given are searched. This is also useful when searching for
            patterns that start with a dash.
             
    -r, --replace <ARG>                     
            Replace every match with the string given when printing results. Neither
            this flag nor any other flag will modify your files.
            
            Capture group indices (e.g., $5) and names (e.g., $foo) are supported in
            the replacement string.
            
            Note that the replacement by default replaces each match, and NOT the
            entire line. To replace the entire line, you should match the entire
            line.
             
    -S, --smart-case                        
            Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case
            sensitively otherwise. This is overridden by either -s/--case-sensitive
            or -i/--ignore-case.
             
        --sort-files
            Sort results by file path. Note that this currently disables all
            parallelism and runs search in a single thread.
             
    -a, --text
            Search binary files as if they were text.
             
    -j, --threads <ARG>
            The approximate number of threads to use. A value of 0 (which is the
            default) causes ripgrep to choose the thread count using heuristics.
             
    -t, --type <TYPE>...                    
            Only search files matching TYPE. Multiple type flags may be provided.
            Use the --type-list flag to list all available types.
             
        --type-add <TYPE>...                
            Add a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can be added at
            a time. Multiple --type-add flags can be provided. Unless --type-clear
            is used, globs are added to any existing globs defined inside of
            ripgrep.
            
            Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type
            settings are NOT persisted.
            
            Example: rg --type-add 'foo:*.foo' -tfoo PATTERN.
            
            --type-add can also be used to include rules from other types with the
            special include directive. The include directive permits specifying one
            or more other type names (separated by a comma) that have been defined
            and its rules will automatically be imported into the type specified.
            For example, to create a type called src that matches C++, Python and
            Markdown files, one can use:
            
            --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md'
            
            Additional glob rules can still be added to the src type by using the
            --type-add flag again:
            
            --type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md' --type-add 'src:*.foo'
            
            Note that type names must consist only of Unicode letters or numbers.
            Punctuation characters are not allowed.
             
        --type-clear <TYPE>...              
            Clear the file type globs previously defined for TYPE. This only clears
            the default type definitions that are found inside of ripgrep.
            
            Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type
            settings are NOT persisted.
             
        --type-list                         
            Show all supported file types and their corresponding globs.
             
    -T, --type-not <TYPE>...                
            Do not search files matching TYPE. Multiple type-not flags may be
            provided. Use the --type-list flag to list all available types.
             
    -u, --unrestricted                      
            Reduce the level of "smart" searching. A single -u won't respect
            .gitignore (etc.) files. Two -u flags will additionally search hidden
            files and directories. Three -u flags will additionally search binary
            files. -uu is roughly equivalent to grep -r and -uuu is roughly
            equivalent to grep -a -r.
             
    -V, --version                           
            Prints version information

        --vimgrep                           
            Show results with every match on its own line, including line numbers
            and column numbers. With this option, a line with more than one match
            will be printed more than once.
             
    -H, --with-filename                     
            Display the file name for matches. This is the default when more than
            one file is searched. If --heading is enabled, the file name will be
            shown above clusters of matches from each file; otherwise, the file name
            will be shown on each match.
             
    -w, --word-regexp
            Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries. This is equivalent to
            putting \b before and after all of the search patterns.
